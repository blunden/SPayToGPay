SPayToGPay
============

A helper app to remap the Samsung Pay button shortcut on the
Galaxy Watch 4 to Google Pay on watches in regions shipping
without Samsung Pay.

Watches that ship without Samsung Pay end up with a long-press
shortcut that they can't remap. This app makes the shortcut
launch Google Pay instead.
